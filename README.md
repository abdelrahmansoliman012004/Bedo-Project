# ðŸŽ“ Bedo Project â€“ Student Grade Prediction using XGBoost

This repository is part of our internship at **Bedo Innovating Education**.  
Developed by **Abdelrahman Mohamed Mahmoud** and **Nour Mohamed** under the guidance of **Eng. Zainab**.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

This project is a multi-class classification system to predict university student final grades (`A+`, `A`, `B+`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`) based on academic and behavioral indicators such as attendance, participation, and assessments.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Help identify students at academic risk early by predicting final grades using machine learning.  
This can assist educators in planning timely interventions and support strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Contains the dataset (student_dataset.csv)
â”œâ”€â”€ models/ # Saved trained models (e.g., xgb_model.pkl)
â”œâ”€â”€ results/ # Evaluation reports with timestamps
â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # Python source files (e.g., train_model.py)

â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt# Required Python packages
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore # Files/folders to be ignored by Git

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bedo-Student-Grade-Prediction.git
   cd Bedo-Student-Grade-Prediction

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
3. **Run the training script:**

   ```bash
    python src/train_model.py

**Outputs:**

Evaluation reports saved in: results/

Trained model saved in: models/

**ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics**
